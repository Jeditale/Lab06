## [Lesson06](index.md) > Exercise02:

1. Open class [App](app/src/main/java/org/dii/oop/App.java) in package `org.dii.oop.App` and edit the code as display below: 
   ```
   package org.dii.oop;

   import org.dii.oop.lesson06.exercise02.Lesson;
   public class App {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       lesson.run();
    }
   }
   ```

2. Edit class [Lesson](app/src/main/java/org/dii/oop/lesson06/exercise02/Lesson.java) in package `org.dii.oop.lesson06.exercise02` to match your Exercise01' Lesson.java at least the logic part.

3. At this point, your exercise02 should be identical to exercise01.

4. Extend ArrayList to be your own class. The error may occur a lot, just try to figure it out.

5. The new functions in extended ArrayList should have this custom functions.

    - listAllShapes() 
        the result of this function is to print the shape object detail as displayed in the option 4 in excercise01.

    - sumArea() 
        the result of this function is to print area summation of all stored shapes in your list.

6. Use listAllShapes() function from extended arrayList to display the result as option 4 selected.

7. Use sumArea() function from extended arrayList to display the result as new option 5 selected.

7. Run the code:
   ```
   1. Circle
   2. Rectangle
   3. Square
   4. Display all shape
   5. Show summation of area
   6. Exit
   Please select [1-5]: 1
   
   Enter radius: 5
   
   1. Circle
   2. Rectangle
   3. Square
   4. Display all shape
   5. Show summation of area
   6. Exit
   Please select [1-5]: 2
   
   Enter width: 5
   Enter high: 5

   Name: Rectangle, Number of side: 4, Area: 25.00, Perimeter: 20.00
   Name: Square, Number of side: 4, Area: 25.00, Perimeter: 20.00

   1. Circle
   2. Rectangle
   3. Square
   4. Display all shape
   5. Show summation of area
   6. Exit
   Please select [1-5]: 5
   
   summation of area is 128.50
